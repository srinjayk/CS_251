Task 1:

Step 1: Download the package and extract it on the desktop.
Command: tar xvzf package.tar.gz

Step 2:Go to the package.
Command: cd package

Step 3: We need to see the standard error after running runme1 , so we need to transfer the standard error to the standar out and clear standard out buffer to temp directory.
Command: ./runme1 2>&1 >temp

Step 4:Now we have the file descriptor and the signal on the terminal. We would now run the second executable file. We would then need to push the file descriptor 4 to stdout so that we could have that.
Command: ./runme2 4>&1

Step 5:We now run the program in the background and then check if the program is running.
Command: Ctrl+Z (for sending the program in background) bg(for resuming if the program in background)

Step 6: We now need to see the jobs running and the processes that are being executed.
Command: jobs(for checking the run status of the background process)
         ps (for the processes, we would later need the process id for sending the signal to runme2)

Step 7: The signal is 'sigusr1'.  The kill code for 'sigusr1' is '10'. We can see that code by execution of kill
Command: kill -l (for checking the number for signal sigusr1 in the list of all signal)
         kill -10 3608 (3608 is the pid)

Step 8: We now get the secret code.
Command: CS251 is really awesome!

Step 9: To kill the job, we might need to run 'sigkill'.
Command: kill -9 3608 (3608 is the pid

Task 2:
Have been commented in the script.
