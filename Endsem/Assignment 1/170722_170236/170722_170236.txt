Assignment 1 CS251

1.  Download the "pacakge.tar.gz" file.
2.  Unzip the file.
	 Code: tar xvzf package.tar.gz
3.  Change the Directory inside the package directory
	 Code: cd package
4.  List down all the files and folders inside package along with inode number.
	 Code: ls -lai
5.  Check the file type of create_asgn.
	 Code: file create_asgn
6.  As output is an executable file so execute create_asgn
	 Code: ./create_asgn
7.  As a file asgn is created change the directory in it.
	 Code: ls -lai
		   cd asgn
8.  Check all the file inside asgn/
	 Code: ls -lai
9.  As we have run_me as a link to bin/.run_me so changing directory into bin and running ./.run_me
	 Code: cd bin
		   ls -lai
10. We can see different inode number of bin/.run_me and run_me so run_me is a soft_link and bin/.run_me dosent have execute permission so changing the rights
	 Code: chmod u+x .run_me
11. Now running .run_me would give an error to make a directory named output.
	 Code: ./.run_me
12. Making a directory named output and running .run_me again
	 Code: mkdir output
		   ./.run_me
13. Checking inside Output we find the code.html file
	 Code: ls -lai output/code.html
